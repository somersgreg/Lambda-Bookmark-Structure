# Λ_LlAMA LINKS

### Llama Links is a bookmark folder structure that follows the LS syllabus and contains limited but useful links to get students started and keep them organized.

## Q. Why did I start this?

### A. Mainly to help others, but also during my time so far at Lambda School I . . . 
*  ...didn't have instant recall of where I found a solution so I could revisit or explain how I accomplished a thing.
*  ...was trying to teach someone a thing when I could have shared a link to how I learned that thing.
*  ...lost my work not remembering in which sandbox I was working for that particular project.
*  ...was unsure of a project title to submit in the retrospective because the project names differ. 
*  ...took much longer to find a reference during a sprint because I had to google something and forgot the exact query I'd used.
*  ...wished I had saved bookmarks by *when* I used them instead of by *subject* because they built up fast in areas and overlap was an issue.
*  ...found many links I needed at a certain time became redundant or inconsequential later either because I mastered the thing or the concept was no longer needed.
*  ...discovered not having a link plan resulted in an unhelpful mess.

## What are the benefits?

*  Simplicity and cross platform standardization.
*  Room for improvement and potential knowledge based web app integration.
*  Ability to add links to a folder without worrying about organizing, losing, or creating disorder.
*  Seeking and sharing is enhanced especially if a web app is developed.
*  Ease of finding links you need during a sprint exam.
*  Give a better overview of student progress while maintaining a history as well.
*  Opening a discussion about organisation and work flow processes is an underdeveloped yet fundamental learning skill set.
*  Helping students with organization may result in:
      1. Reduced mental stress and student retention.
      1. Increased learning potential.
      1. More successful testing and progression.
      1. Facilitated sharing and teamwork.

# The Way This Works (Install)

1. Download the folder as a zip by pressing the code button and download as a .zip file.

1. Open the zip and drag the .html file to desktop or a temp folder.
1. In browser: Import Bookmarks or Favorites as an HTML.

### I wish to stress that nothing bad will happen by downloading these links. They can be easily deleted from any browser by right clicking on the top folder and sending to trash.
### I've included some links I thought would be useful to new students.
### Feedback please.
#### Different browsers will force rename the top folder.  I can't figure out how to stop this.  Preferred title is ' Λ_LlAMA LINKS'. 

I hope this helps.
